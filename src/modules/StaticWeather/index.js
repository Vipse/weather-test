                Weather
                The weather is a subject we can always talk about. It often changes and brings cold and heat,
                sunshine and rain, frost and snow.
            </p>

                One day is often unlike the next. In summer the sun shines, often there is no wind and there are no
                clouds in the sky which is blue and beautiful. We can see stars and the moon at night and people
                like walks, outdoor games and sports in the fresh air.

                When autumn comes, the days become shorter and colder. It gets dark earlier and often heavy clouds
                cover the sky bringing rain with them.
                Sometimes there is heavy rain, so that an umbrella or a raincoat is necessary if we don't want to
                get wet through. Then you can hear people say, "What bad weather! When is this rain going to stop?"
                Many people then catch cold and must go to bed. Then a fire at home is so pleasant. At last frost
                and snow come.
            </p>

                Fields, forests and houses are covered with snow and rivers and lakes with ice. But spring again
                brings sunshine and warm winds. Sometimes it snows but snow will not remain long, it will melt in
                the warm sun. Spring will bring bright sunshine, green grass and flowers.

                We usually say: "A nice day", "Not a bad day" or "It's nice weather for the time of the year" if the
                weather is fine.
                We can say: "It looks like rain", "It looks like snow" of "It's bad weather" when the weather is
                bad.
